<P> <B>Modinagar is a town and a municipal board in Ghaziabad district in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It's just 24 km from Ghaziabad city, 48 km from New Delhi. It is a part of National Capital Region. It has various famous spots such as modi mandir and jain shikanji which are worth a visit.

The city was founded in 1933 by Rai Bahadur Gujar Mal Modi who established the Modi Group of Industries here along with his brother, Kedar Nath Modi. It is approximately 45 kilometres north-east of New Delhi. It is situated on Ghaziabad Meerut National Highway No. 58, approximately equally distant from Meerut and Ghaziabad. It is best known as the home of business conglomerate Modi Enterprises. In recent years, Modinagar has been developed as an educational hub as many new institutions are being established in and around the city due to its location in National Capital Region. Modinagar is also a part of Delhiâ€“Meerut Regional Rapid Transit System.</P></b>
